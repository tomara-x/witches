;the interval (p6) isn't a range covered before repeating the ratios,
;it's rather a ratio multiplier for each iteration of the ratios.
;every cycly (after the first) the ratios are multiplied by that factor (.5)

;nope this seems wrong? the POWER function? aaaa i don't know what's what anymore!
;never work when you're out of it, kids

;it IS the ratio of interval covered before repeating, and that's why it's a mult!
;holup i think the opposite is more accurate?
;CLOSEST!
;it IS a ratio multiplier after each cycle through the ratios, and that's why
;it is the interval covered by the ratios as they are given?
