printarray(fillarray:i(1,2,3,7))
;this is a return type (not rate) modifier for polymorphic opcodes
;so actually it's trying to return an i rate scalar when given :i
;what would be more accurate is fillarray:i[] but that's not a thing (for now at least)
;the error message is so very ambiguous tho:
;"opcode 'fillarray' for expression with arg types cccc not found"
;lol! it ain't inputs you gotta worry about, silly!
