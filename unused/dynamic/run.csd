//recompile a csd file and rerun its main instr every n seconds.
//allowing me to edit files and hear the reaults as the file is saved

//very messy, it's like hitting a reset (so that's kinda bad for testing sequences)
//but can be useful with the Q of basma, or slower recompile rate
//also it'd be great for testing out drone things with faster rate
//or might figure out a way to trigger it manually so it'd be like a refresh button

//^ lol i didn't know about blue back then
